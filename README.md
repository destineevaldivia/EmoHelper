# EmoHelper

Premise: Emotional awareness is the process of recognizing and acknowledging your feelings. Naming the emotion and being curious about it, can help you accept your feelings.

Pitch: I’m creating an app that prompts users to choose/name an emotion that they'd like to focus on.
Then, the app will generate two songs from the user’s personal Spotify playlist based on the input
Next, the user will be asked to select one of two tracks that best captures their emotional state. Pondering which song captures your emotions, is not only a creative task, but also a way to acknowledge your feelings.

Lastly, the user will be prompted to embrace it or let it go.
