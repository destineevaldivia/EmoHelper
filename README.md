# Overview:

EmoHelper is a validation journal that helps you name your emotions and uses the Spotify Web Api to find a track from your own personal library that might evoke a similar feeling, based on the track's valence attributes.

Lastly the app generates a statement which I’m calling "emo entries".

Emotional awareness is the process of recognizing and acknowledging your feelings. Naming the emotion and being curious about it, can help you accept your feelings.

Pitch: I'm creating an emotion + music journal. The app uses your emotional input and other user input to create a journal entry, that I'm calling "Emo Entry" to log to the databse.

How does it work: The app prompts user to choose an emotion that they'd like to focus on.
Then, the app will find two songs from the user’s personal Spotify playlist that match the corresponding valence score, which is a measure of how positive or negative the audio feature of that song are. The user will select one that best represents their emotional state.Pondering which song captures your emotions, is not only a creative task, but also a way to acknowledge your feelings.

Lastly, the user will be prompted to embrace it or let it go.

All of the user input is then aggregated to generate a journal entry, that I'm calling "Emo Entry" which can be saved to the database.

Nice-to-Have's:
In the future, I'd like to not only save the user input data to create a journal entry, but also to redirect them to a dashboard that shows a list of all their emo entries, and potentially creates a emotion playlist on spotify that reflects the journal entry selections.
